# Image Quantification 101

### To use
1. Create conda environment from yaml file:
    ```
    conda env create -f imagequant101_env.yml
    ```

2. Activate environment:
    ```
    source activate imagequant101
    ```
    
3. Start jupyter server:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    
4. Explore and modify the various `.ipynb` notebooks

5. Answer sheets can be found on the `solutions` folder. To run them, simply move the [Solution] notebook you would like to run to the base `imagequantification101` repository.

### Troubleshooting
If the conda environment fails to install from the yml file, create it manually with the following:

    conda create -y -n imagequant101 -c conda-forge python=3.9
    source activate imagequant101
    pip install jupyter
    pip install imageio
    pip install scikit-image
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install pandas
    pip install seaborn
    pip install pyefd
